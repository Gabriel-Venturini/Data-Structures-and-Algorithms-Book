The chapters for this book are organized to provide a pedagogical path that starts with the basics of Python programming and object-oriented-design. We then add foundational techniques like algorithm analysis and recursion. In the main portion of the book, we present fundamental data structures and algorithms, concluding with a discussion of memory management (that is, the architectural underpinnings of data structures). Specifically, the chapters for this book are organized as follows:

1. Python Primer
2. Object-Oriented-Programming
3. Algorithm Analysis
4. Recursion
5. Array-Based Sequences
6. Stacks, Queues, and Deques
7. Linked Lists
8. Trees
9. Priority Queues
10. Maps, Hash Tables, and Skip Lists
11. Search Trees
12. Sorting and Selection
13. Text Processing
14. Graph Algorithms
15. Memory Management and B-Trees

A. Character Strings in Python
B. Useful Mathematical Facts
