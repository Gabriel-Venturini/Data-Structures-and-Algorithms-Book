<h1>Data-Structures-and-Algorithms-Book</h1>
<p>This repository is a live view of me reading this book. So I am going to update it as soon as I read and learn a new concept about it.
I will probably write the content in the book; Complete the exercises and apply the concept in a random application. All of this organized in folders.</p>
